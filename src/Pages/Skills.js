                Eug√®ne Henri Paul Gauguin, was a French Post-Impressionist artist. 
                Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for 
                his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were 
                distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end of his life, he 
                spent ten years in French Polynesia. The paintings from this 
                time depict people or landscapes from that region.</p>
